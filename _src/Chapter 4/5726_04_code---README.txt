5726_03 - code notes


Three css files are included with this chapter, each containing the relevant css from the theme stylesheet used in the book.


They work as follows:


•	5726_04_01.css
The starting code for our theme's layout, which includes the media queries we added in Chapter 3.


•	5726_04_02.css
The media queries with the CSS for the header added for all screen widths.

•	5726_04_03.css
The media queries with the code for the header and the content/sidebar layout added.

•	5726_04_04.css
The media queries with the code for the header, sidebar/content and footer added - the final code for the Carborelli's site at the end of the chapter.


•	5726_04_05.css
This shows the code snippets from the text which are used to create different widget layouts in the sidebar and footer.


All of these files include commenting so the reader knows which part of the layout what code applies to. The code is also explained in the text.
